The movie follows Naruto's journey as he tries to clear his name and escape from the Blood Prison. Along the way, he meets some allies and enemies, such as RyÅ«zetsu, a female ninja from Kusagakure who has a personal grudge against Mui; Maroi, a Kumogakure ninja who was sent to spy on the prison; and Kazan, a former villager of Yugakure who works for Mui. Naruto also learns that Mui has a hidden agenda behind his harsh treatment of the prisoners: he wants to use Naruto's Nine-Tails chakra to open the Box of Ultimate Bliss, a legendary artifact that can grant any wish, but also unleashes a powerful demon named Satori.
 
Meanwhile, Naruto's friends from Konoha and other villages are also trying to find out the truth behind his arrest and rescue him from the prison. They discover that Naruto was framed by someone who used a special technique to impersonate him and attack the Raikage. They also learn that the Box of Ultimate Bliss is actually a trap that was created by Hiruko, a missing-nin who tried to start a Fourth Shinobi World War years ago. Hiruko intended to use the box to unleash Satori and absorb its power, but he was stopped by Kakashi Hatake and his team. However, the box was stolen by Mui, who wanted to use it to revive his son Muku, who died during Hiruko's attack.
 
The climax of the movie occurs when Mui succeeds in opening the box with Naruto's chakra, but instead of bringing back his son, he unleashes Satori, who possesses Muku's body and goes on a rampage. Naruto and his friends have to fight against Satori and its army of monsters, while also trying to save Muku from its influence. Naruto manages to reach Muku's heart and remind him of his bond with his father, which allows Mui to sacrifice himself and seal Satori back into the box. The movie ends with Naruto being exonerated from all charges and returning to Konoha with his friends, while also honoring the memory of RyÅ«zetsu, who died using a forbidden jutsu to save him.
